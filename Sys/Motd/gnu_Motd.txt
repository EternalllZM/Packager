Message of the day: Dolphin 5.0-16380 has been verified for use with Netplay!

We will now update Packager, Update Gecko Codes, and Patch Dolphin in that order.

If Packager version does not match the latest, exit and restart the script after it is updated (first step).

You must run through all three steps your first time to patch Dolphin successfully.
